# CO2:GDP Ratio

This R project attempted to ascertain how countries and regions were performing in their CO2 emissions. Rather than analyze only the CO2 emissions by country, this project factors in countries' GDPs to better account for the claim of a need for CO2 emissions. Thus, I analyze the CO2:GDP ratio across the globe.

## Data Visualization
